## Introduction

Elections are a fundamental part of any democracy in the world. But, the process of selecting the leaders is always fraught with impediments. Violence, booth capturing and identity erasure have run rampant throughout India’s past elections.  With political parties using social media to drive communication strategies and data analytics for targeted political campaigns, the possibility of rogue actors and adversarial states exploiting digital technology to harm the integrity of the election process, cannot be ruled out. 
American allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections and the role of firms like Cambridge Analytica, demonstrate how elections can be manipulated by malicious actors through:
targeting of election infrastructure andpropaganda operations aimed at influencing voter behaviour. 
Such instances have made cyber security a critical part of Indian electioneering. 


## Project Description

The project requires ATM booth-like structures to be placed in every constituency requiring only a security guard for routine safety checks. There is no need of a fixed booth for a specific constituency. Every person’s vote is linked with their aadhar number and the digital signatures are their biometrics from the aadhar database, which are then verified using our 2 layer security authentication.

The pipeline consists of a two layer authentication system for secure voting.
New Voters are added to the voter’s list when they turn eighteen automatically using aadhar database.
First layer is  the biometric verification, which includes fingerprint scan for two thumbs and an iris scan. This will then be verified with the biometric data of the voter from the aadhar database. 
The second layer consists of the voter clicking a picture of himself while voting, which is then verified with the picture from his aadhar card. With the picture, the vote can be visually verified that it was cast by the registered voter. 
Both the layers have a blockchain network independent to each other.
Following the authentication, the user is asked to cast his vote on a screen that is immediately uploaded to the cloud to  avoid any discrepancies.
Our goal is to make the election process as simple and secure as withdrawing money from an ATM machine.
The project also renders the Election Commission obsolete, decreasing the chances of corruption even further.
Using cloud, the results are announced immediately and all the polling booths are closed instead of waiting for days for the results.
